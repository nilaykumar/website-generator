  Hi! I'm Nilay.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a mathematician with pretty
  broad interests. I like learning about and creating new things.
  Sometimes I go as far as to write things down and put them on this
  website.
</p>

<p>
  I recently completed my PhD in mathematical physics at Northwestern
  in 2021. I am currently looking for career opportunities that involve
  problem solving via mathematics and code in creative and collaborative ways.
